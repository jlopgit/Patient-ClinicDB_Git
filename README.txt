Patient-Clinic Database

This application is to serve as a facility database containing patient info including their name, address, phone number, ssn, dob, insurance info, date of services, as well as reasons for their visits. This project was written in Java, and it also incorporates XML for the basic structure of the GUI, and SQLite to store all the patient info.
